Oscillations caused by Stick Slip Friction in Disk-Disk Contact
==============
This code simulates stick slip friction for an experimental setup where two disks are in contact. The lower one is being driven at a constant angular velocity while the upper one is connected to a spring whose other is fixed and attached to a sensor. This results in oscillation of the upper disk and this code stores and plots the time history of angular displacement as well as velocity.
